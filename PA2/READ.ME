Project 2 Description: 
"In  this assignment you will write a program that allows a database user to insert, delete, modify, and query their dataon basic tables (i.e., no table joins). 
It is assumed that the database and table structures (i.e., their metadata) are available, whichshould have been completed in the first assignment."

Project Design:
I have designed my tables to be row-based tuples in which each row cooresponds to one complete tuple.
Like Project 1, my code can be run with standard input.
